# Dependences

The external dependences for this applications are:
  - <a href="https://github.com/wjwwood/serial">Serial</a> for serial port communication, a modified light version is Included as 3rdParty library. <br>
    NOTE: The official version of serial library available on github will not work, refer to the third party folder in this package.
  - QT  v. >6.4.1, for GUI - https://www.qt.io/
  - nsis http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page - only to generate the installation package
  - <a href="http://www.cmake.org">CMake</a> to generate the solution for your system and build. 
  - To install on some previous windows version you may need to update your Universal C Runtime in Windows <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2999226/update-for-universal-c-runtime-in-windows">here</a>


# Building Instructions:

Use CMake to generate the solution for your system, see http://www.cmake.org
It is advised to set your build folder OUT of the source code folder, the build should be independent from the code. 


### Windows 
in the case you don't have environmental variables set you should find manually some dependences path:
" \__\" folder, in case of QT libraries, C:/___/Qt/__your_version___/__compiler__ersion__/lib/cmake/Qt5_library 

In my experience everything is automatically found, but sometimes some QT specific package folder needs to be set manually, I will solve this soon! 

configure --->  generate

To build the package in windows the variable WINDDEPLOYQT_EXECUTABLE need to point to "your_qt_folder/bin/windeployqt.exe "

### Linux 

CMake --> configure --> generate 

### List of cmake options 

 - ENABLE_verbose    -- default off
 - VLD_MemoryCheck   -- default off
 - ENABLE_SOLUTION_FOLDERS  -- default on
 - ENABLE_setLocalDebugEnvironment  -- default off
 - ENABLE_BUILD_3rdParty  -- default on 
 - ENABLE_BUILD_libs  -- default on
 - ENABLE_BUILD_plugins -- default off (no plugins yet)
 - ENABLE_BUILD_apps  - default off
 - ENABLE_BUILD_install -- default on
 - ENABLE_BUILD_package -- default on
 - ENABLE_WINDEPLOYQT -- default off
 
For each application in the folder, an option is also automatically added to allows the user to select which application to build. 
 
### Doxygen documentation 

To generate the doxygen documentation of the ppc1api go you need to have <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/">Doxygen</a> installed, 
then go the the /docs/Doxyfile_labonatip.in and run.
